Readme:

I ran into an issue with getting the search results from Google. 
As Google ask for cookie consent in the UK, the only way I could get around it was to use a VPN and set the virtual location to outide of the UK and EU (I used USA).

Once the VPN is running I could get the results back from Google and process them, if a VPN is not used and set to a non-cookies consent country - I'm afraid the scraper won't work.

I do use a database, I have added a migration to create the schema.

Or the sql script is in the github folder.


Please ensure the api is running at this path and port: https://localhost:7101 as the client code send requests to that url. The swagger page is at https://localhost:7101/swagger/index.html

I deleted the bin and obj folders in case it causes problems with virus scans.

Full disclosure, I ran out of time a little on this task, the cookie problem ate a lot of my time 
but it was an enjoyable task and I hope it runs ok for you. Any problems/questions please
email me at david.keylock@gmail.com.

Many thanks
